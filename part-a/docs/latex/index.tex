Blink\+DB is an efficient {\bfseries{in-\/memory key-\/value store}} that leverages both in-\/memory and on-\/disk storage to provide quick data access and high write speeds. The project employs an in-\/memory hashtable alongside disk storage for evicted entries (when the main memory starts to fill up), ensuring scalability when the dataset grows large. Additionally, it integrates a bloom filter and a sparse index to optimize read operations and disk lookups.\hypertarget{index_architecture}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Architecture}{Architecture}}\label{index_architecture}
The architecture of Blink\+DB consists of\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item In-\/\+Memory Hashtable\+: Utilizes open addressing with double hashing to store key-\/value pairs until the load factor reaches 70\%.
\item Resizing and Rehashing\+: When feasible (i.\+e., if memory usage is below 1GB), the hashtable is resized and rehashed to accommodate more entries.
\item Disk Storage Eviction\+: If resizing is not possible, 50\% of the in-\/memory entries are evicted to disk storage to free up memory.
\item Disk Storage\+: Maintains evicted entries and is optimized using a sparse index for faster file lookups.
\item Bloom Filter\+: Quickly rules out non-\/existent keys to reduce unnecessary disk accesses during read operations.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_operations}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Operations}{Operations}}\label{index_operations}
Blink\+DB provides the following core functionalities\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item SET\+: Insert or update a key-\/value pair in the store.
\item GET\+: Retrieve the value associated with a given key, first by checking in-\/memory storage, then, if needed, falling back to disk storage.
\item DEL\+: Delete a key-\/value pair from the in-\/memory store.
\item print\+: Output the current contents of the in-\/memory store to the console.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_cleanup}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Cleanup}{Cleanup}}\label{index_cleanup}
Upon termination, Blink\+DB {\bfseries{ensures}} that both in-\/memory and disk data are cleared, maintaining data integrity and resource management. This was achieved after much deliberation and hours of testing using Valgrind and GDB.\hypertarget{index_author}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Author}{Author}}\label{index_author}
