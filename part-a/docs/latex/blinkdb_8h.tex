\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Defines the blinkdb class, a key-\/value store with in-\/memory and disk storage.

This file introduces the blinkdb class which implements an in-\/memory key-\/value store database. The design uses an in-\/memory hashtable (with open addressing and double hashing) to store key-\/value pairs. When the hashtable becomes 70\% full, it checks if its size is greater than 1GB. If no, it resizes and rehashes the existing eentries. Else, it evicts 50\% of entries to disk storage. It leverages a sparse index for file lookups. A bloom filter is used to optimize read operations by quickly ruling out non-\/existent keys and saving a disk-\/access.

The class provides basic operations\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item SET\+: Insert a key-\/value pair into the store.
\item GET\+: Retrieve the value corresponding to a given key, fetching from memory first, then disk if needed.
\item DEL\+: Delete a key-\/value pair from the in-\/memory store.
\item print\+: Print the contents of the in-\/memory store.
\end{DoxyItemize}

The design ensures that when the user exits, all stored data, both in memory and on disk, are cleared (obviously).
