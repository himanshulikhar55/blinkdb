\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Implements a memory pool for managing \doxylink{structBlock}{Block} objects.

This file defines the memorypool class, which is responsible for allocating and deallocating memory blocks, each represented by a \doxylink{structBlock}{Block} object that can store key-\/value pairs. The memory pool maintains a fixed-\/size vector of Blocks and uses a queue to track available (unused) blocks.

The allocation function assigns a key-\/value pair to the first available block and marks it as used, ensuring efficient memory usage. The deallocation function returns a block to the pool for future reuse.

This design is intended for scenarios where managing a collection of key-\/value pairs in memory is crucial for performance and resource utilization.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
The memorypool relies on the \doxylink{structBlock}{Block} class declared in "{}block.\+h"{}, and it uses C++ Standard Library facilities like std\+::vector and std\+::queue.
