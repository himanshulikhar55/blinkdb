\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Implementation of a concurrent skiplist data structure. 

This file provides the implementation of a skiplist data structure using C++. The skiplist is designed to support efficient insertion and search operations, leveraging probabilistic balancing and atomic operations for thread safety.

The data structure consists of\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A nested Node struct, representing each node in the skiplist, which holds a key, a stream offset, and a vector of atomic pointers to subsequent nodes at different levels.
\item Member functions for inserting nodes and retrieving the nearest offset for a given key.
\end{DoxyItemize}

The design uses a probabilistic method for promoting nodes to higher levels based on a user-\/defined probability, ensuring balanced performance across operations.

Typical usage example\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\mbox{\hyperlink{classskiplist}{skiplist}}\ sl;}
\DoxyCodeLine{sl.\mbox{\hyperlink{classskiplist_aa193aa8a10a77cbf6bddca202b5c253a}{insert}}(\textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}example\_key"{}},\ 42);}
\DoxyCodeLine{std::streampos\ pos\ =\ sl.\mbox{\hyperlink{classskiplist_aa1d31fd7a91a970ce89658791be4872e}{get\_nearest\_offset}}(\textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}another\_key"{}});}

\end{DoxyCode}


\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
This implementation showcases concurrency control using std\+::atomic and assumes that the environment supports C++11 or later.
