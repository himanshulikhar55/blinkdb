\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Custom Hashtable implementation using open addressing with double hashing.

This file contains the declaration and implementation of a custom hashtable that employs open addressing with double hashing for collision resolution. Each entry in the hashtable is represented by an Entry struct containing an atomic occupancy flag, a key string, and a pointer to a memory-\/managed \doxylink{structBlock}{Block}. The hashtable integrates several components including\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A custom memory pool for managing dynamic memory allocation.
\item Disk storage for offloading key-\/value pairs via the evict() function.
\item A sparse index for maintaining and updating disk entries.
\item A bloom filter to provide efficient approximate membership tests.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Key features include\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Atomic operations ensuring thread-\/safety in the manipulation of table entries.
\item Dynamic resizing of the table based on occupancy thresholds, monitored by a dedicated background thread.
\item Standard hashtable operations such as insert, get, del, and evict.
\end{DoxyItemize}

The implementation is designed to efficiently handle memory and disk storage operations, making use of modern C++ features such as move semantics, std\+::atomic, and multithreading.
