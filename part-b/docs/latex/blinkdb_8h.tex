\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Defines the blinkdb class, a key-\/value store with in-\/memory and disk storage.

This file introduces the blinkdb class which implements a key-\/value store. The design uses an in-\/memory hashtable (with open addressing and double hashing) to store key-\/value pairs. When the hashtable becomes full, it evicts entries to disk storage and leverages a sparse index for file lookups. A bloom filter is used to optimize read operations by quickly ruling out non-\/existent keys.

The class provides basic operations\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item set\+: Insert a key-\/value pair into the store.
\item get\+: Retrieve the value corresponding to a given key, fetching from memory first, then disk if needed.
\item del\+: Delete a key-\/value pair from the in-\/memory store.
\end{DoxyItemize}

The design ensures that when the user exits, all stored data, both in memory and on disk, are cleared.
